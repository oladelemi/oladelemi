# Intro

Hi, I’m Abdulateef, but friends (and people avoiding pronunciation anxiety) call me Lateef.
I think i’ve heard almost every version of my name under the sun, so no judgment here. Just call me something smart/fun, and we’re good.


I’m a Software Developer, Data Scientist, sometimes an HR guy or Freelancer who loves turning complex problems into clean, maybe cool solutions. Whether I’m wrangling data, building systems, or working on other ideas in my free time, I bring curiosity, creativity, and a nice cup of tea to the table.
