## Template for my personal Website.


Started this back when i was graduating college and it's been interesting to keep up with. 


### This template is built for reuse
To reuse, download the code from the master branch and follow these steps 

- `npm install` - sets up npm environment
- `npm audit fix`  - audits and applies recommended updates to all the supporting packages, you can also use `npm audit fix --force` to override protections and force all updates 
- `npm start`  - launches the web page on localhost
- edit files in src to match suit your liking
- `npm run build` - creates your production build
- `npm run predeploy` - prepares your deployment build 
- `npm run deploy` - deploys updates to your github gh-pages directory
- `npm run cleanup` - cleans up your code. removes build directory 

finally you can push changes to your git for safekeeping 






This is adapted from the website template created by Michael D'Angelo.
