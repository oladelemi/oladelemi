## Template for my personal Website.


Started this back when i was graduating college and it's been interesting to keep up with. 


### This template is built for reuse
To reuse, download the code from the master branch and follow these steps 

npm install - sets up npm environment 
npm audit fix  - audits and applies recommended updates to all the supporting packages
npm start  - launches the web page on localhost
edit files in src to match suit your liking
npm run build - creates your production build
npm run predeploy - pushes updates to your github gh-pages directory







This is adapted from the website template created by Michael D'Angelo.
